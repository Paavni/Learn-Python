1: SIR NATHANIEL

2: I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner

3: have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without

4: scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without

5: impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-

6: out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with

7: a companion of the king’s, who is intituled, nomi-

8: nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.

9: 

10: HOLOFERNES

11: Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his

12: discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye

13: ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general

14: behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is

15: too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it

16: were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

17: 

18: SIR NATHANIEL

19: A most singular and choice epithet.

20: 

21: HOLOFERNES

22: He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer

23: than the staple of his argument. I abhor such

24: fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and

25: point-devise companions; such rackers of

26: orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should

27: say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,–d,

28: e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;

29: half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh

30: abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,–which he

31: would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of

32: insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.

33: …

34: MOTH

35: [Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast

36: of languages, and stolen the scraps.

37: 

38: COSTARD

39: O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.

40: I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;

41: for thou art not so long by the head as

42: honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier

43: swallowed than a flap-dragon.
