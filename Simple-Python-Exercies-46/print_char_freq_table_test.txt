OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai walks down the sidewalk. She passes a sign that says "Stars Hollow Founded 1779" and crosses the street. She goes into Luke's Diner. Inside, she takes off her coat and picks up an empty mug from a table, then walks up to the counter]

LORELAI: Please, Luke. Please, please, please.

LUKE: How many cups have you had this morning?

LORELAI: None.

LUKE: Plus...

LORELAI: Five, but yours is better.

LUKE: You have a problem.

LORELAI: Yes, I do.

[Luke fills her cup]

LUKE: Junkie.

LORELAI: Angel. You've got wings, baby.

[The phone rings as Lorelai goes back to her table. Luke answers it.]

LUKE: Luke's. [pause] Yeah.

[A young guy seated at the counter turns and watches Lorelai sip her coffee, then gets up and approaches her.]

JOEY: You make that look really good.

LORELAI: Oh, it is really good. It's the best coffee in town.

JOEY: Oh yeah? I'll have to get a cup.

LORELAI: Good plan.

JOEY: Yeah, I've never been here before. Just, uh, passing through on my way to Hartford.

LORELAI: You're a regular Jack Kerouac.

JOEY: Yeah.

LORELAI: Yeah.

JOEY: Hey, you mind if I sit down?

LORELAI: Oh, you know what? Actually, I'm meeting someone so I. . .

[Joey sits down at her table]

JOEY: I'm Joey.

LORELAI: Okay.

JOEY: What, you don't have a name?

LORELAI: No, I do have a name. I just, I'm really meeting someone, so. . .

JOEY: So I guess I should get going.

LORELAI: So soon?

JOEY: What?

LORELAI: I'm just screwing with your mind, Joey. It's nice to meet you. Enjoy Hartford.

JOEY: Enjoy your coffee, mystery woman.

LORELAI: Hm. I like that.

[As Joey goes back to the counter, Rory walks in and sits across from Lorelai.]

RORY: Hey. It's freezing.

LORELAI: Oh, what do you need? Hot tea, coffee?

RORY: Lip gloss.

LORELAI: Aha.

[Lorelai pulls a makeup bag out of her purse.]

LORELAI: I have vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and toasted marshmallow.

RORY: Anything in there not resembling a breakfast cereal?

LORELAI: Yes.

[Lorelai pulls out another bag.]

LORELAI: It has no smell but it changes colors with your mood.

RORY: God, RuPaul doesn't need this much makeup.

LORELAI: Wow, you're crabby.

RORY: I'm sorry. I lost my Macy Gray CD and I need caffeine.

LORELAI: Ooh, I have your CD. [pulls the CD out of her purse]

RORY: Thief.

LORELAI: Sorry, and I will get you some coffee.

[Lorelai picks up another coffee cup and goes back to the counter. Luke gives her a look.]

LORELAI: What? It's not for me. It's for Rory, I swear.

LUKE: You're shameless.
